/*TIP CALCULATOR
Directions:
Build a tip calculator.

Math Hint:
tip amount = Bill amount x (tip percentage / 100)

Requirements:
-Create a Github repository for this project.
-You should have a form where a user is able to input the cost of the meal.
-The form should also let the user choose the percentage tip they want to give.
-When they submit the form, show them the total with tip added.
-Display the total tip amount as well so they know how much they're tipping.
Steps:

-Form  (maybe using ".onSubmit"?)

    needs an input for:
        -cost of the meal (user will input this)
        - desired tip amount (percentage of the cost of the meal)
            could be buttons w percentages - maybe 15%, 20%, 25%, none
    onSubmit, needs to indicate (in HTML):
        -cash amount of tip
        -total cost of the meal
