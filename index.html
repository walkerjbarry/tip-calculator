<!--TIP CALCULATOR
Directions:
Build a tip calculator.

Math Hint:
tip amount = Bill amount x (tip percentage / 100)

Requirements:
-Create a Github repository for this project.
-You should have a form where a user is able to input the cost of the meal.
-The form should also let the user choose the percentage tip they want to give.
-When they submit the form, show them the total with tip added.
-Display the total tip amount as well so they know how much they're tipping.

STEPS / METHOD
-----------------------
     As always, there are many ways to do this. 
     Here, I have chosen a way that is very simple, 
     if not completely optimal, in terms of UX.  
     The HTML structure I have chosen employs input fields for the meal cost as well as the desired gratuity.
